\section*{Experimental part}
\label{sec:experimental}

Our analysis tool was conceived using the \verb|Python| programming language,
version \verb|3.6.3|. It consists of a main component, the analyser
(\verb|analyser.py|), containing the logic for traversing some elements of an
AST, and a pattern module (\verb|pattern.py|) that houses the \verb|Pattern|
class, used to instantiate objects that represent vulnerable patterns which can
be found in the \verb|patterns| file, another component of the tool.
