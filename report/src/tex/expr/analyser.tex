\subsubsection*{Analyser}
\label{sec:expr.analyser}

The main analyser component is run by invoking it and passing it a PHP program
slice in JSON object format as a command line argument.

\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:cmd.run},
    caption={Command line to run analyser}]
    $ analyser.py /path/to/slice.json
\end{lstlisting}

The slice being provided must already be in the form of an AST just like the
ones produced by Glayzzle's PHP Parser \cite{glayzzle-php}. Otherwise, the tool
will not work as it's designed to only accept ASTs with that specific format.
