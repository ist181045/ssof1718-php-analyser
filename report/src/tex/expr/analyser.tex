The main component is run by invoking it and passing it a PHP program slice in
JSON format as a command line argument.

\begin{verbatim}
    analyser.py /path/to/slice.json
\end{verbatim}

The slice is already in the form of an AST, according to the syntax of the AST's
generated by Glayzzle's PHP Parser \cite{glayzzle-php}.
