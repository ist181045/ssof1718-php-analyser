\section*{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Static code analysis is far from a perfect method of detecting vulnerabilities
in non-trivial high-level programming languages due to a vast array of nuances
and non-obvious yet sanitizing mechanisms implemented in a custom way by the
programmers themselves. Yet, these mechanisms might not assure sanitization
either since they might be able to be subverted, meaning the code was vulnerable
in the end. Undeniably, howver, it has become more and more robust through the
introduction of mechanisms such as taint analysis, data mining and code
correction~\cite{Medeiros:2014:ADC:2566486.2568024}.

As far as our tool goes, it is far from achieving the quality of state of the
art tools such as WAP~\cite{Medeiros:2014:ADC:2566486.2568024,wap-manual:2017},
being our tool limited to a very simple and very small subset of an immense
programming language with so many subtleties such as the PHP programming
language.
